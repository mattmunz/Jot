# Jot

A note taking system using Angular.

## Overview

Jot is a simple application for recording events. It is intended to be the "simplest 
useful application" that can grow into something more complicated and interesting.

Jot is a provisional name. Really it is just a button that you press when you experience 
something you want to remember.

## Release Notes

7/14/16 Simple note taking by commandline and web is supported.

## Status

There are currently just some ideas and preliminary designs and UI mockups (see below).
