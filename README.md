# Jot

A note taking system using Angular.

## Overview

Jot is a simple application for recording events. It is intended to be the "simplest 
useful application" that can grow into something more complicated and interesting.

Jot is a provisional name. Really it is just a button that you press when you experience 
something you want to remember.

## Release Notes

7/14/16 Simple note taking by commandline and web is supported.

## Status

Simple note taking by commandline and web is supported. There aren't really deployment instructions so contact me if you need that to get going. Mongodb is needed to host the database where jots are stored.

# User guide

There are two UIs -- commandline and web. 

## Starting the (mongo) database 

### Using MShell

start jd 

### Otherwise

sudo $PROGRAMMING_DIRECTORY/Resources/MongoDB/mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.2.0/bin/mongod --dbpath $PROGRAMMING_DIRECTORY/Jot/deployments/$MSHELL_HOST/data/db
